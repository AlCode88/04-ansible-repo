# Pause module
The pause module in Ansible is used to pause execution of a playbook for a specified amount of time. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as:

1. Waiting for a system to complete a task before continuing with the playbook, for example waiting for a database to fully start up before attempting to connect to it.

2. Introducing a delay between tasks to allow for manual intervention, such as waiting for user input or for a system to finish a previous task.

3. Synchronizing tasks between multiple hosts by introducing a delay between tasks on different hosts to ensure that they are completed in a specific order.

4. Testing the order of tasks and their dependencies by introducing delays between tasks to ensure that they are executed in the correct order.

5. Also supported for Windows OS.
